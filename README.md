# Kaggle-question-pairs-quora

My solution for the Quora Question Pair contest hosted on Kaggle[[1]](https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs)

## Model Implementation

Final submission is the average of 7 LSTM based models and 6 xgboost models with different hyperparameters. LSTM model architecture is based on lystdo[[2]](https://www.kaggle.com/lystdo/lb-0-18-lstm-with-glove-and-magic-features) model on kaggle kernel. Keras architecture of the model is shown below:
